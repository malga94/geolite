# Welcome to GeoLite

## Project Info

This is a free and open source GeoGuessr clone, vibe coded with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)

## Quickstart

Start by cloning the repository with 
```git clone https://github.com/malga94/geolite.git```
and navigating inside the directory with ```cd geolite```

To run the application, you must have node and npm installed. Follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You also need to install Vite with ```npm i vite```, and express for the backend with ```npm i express```

Finally, to play the game you need an API key for the Google Maps API. Creating an API key is completely free and allows you to perform 5000 API calls a month for free, which means playing 5000 levels of the game.  
To create the API key, you first need to enable the Maps JavaScript API in [google cloud platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list). Then navigate to the Keys and Credentials page, and create an API key.

Once you have everything installed, run ```npm run dev``` in the root directory of the project. The app is now running locally on your machine, and you can access it via http://localhost:8080/
